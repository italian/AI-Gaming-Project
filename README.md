# AI Gaming Project: Neural Adventure

Neural Adventure is a simple yet engaging 2D platformer game that leverages machine learning and artificial intelligence for dynamic gameplay. In this project, we explore the integration of AI to enhance game mechanics, enemy behaviors, and level design, creating an immersive and adaptive gaming experience.

## Features

- **AI-Powered Enemies:** Enemies that adapt to the player's actions using machine learning models.
- **Dynamic Level Generation:** Procedurally generated levels that offer a unique experience each time you play.
- **Player Abilities:** Smooth and intuitive controls with the ability to unlock new abilities as you progress.
- **Engaging Gameplay:** A blend of challenging obstacles, exciting power-ups, and interactive environments.

## Technology Stack

- **Python:** The primary programming language used for development.
- **Pygame:** A library for creating 2D games with Python.
- **TensorFlow:** A machine learning library used to train and implement AI models.
- **NumPy:** A library for numerical computations in Python.
